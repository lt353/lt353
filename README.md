# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

I'm a **student** currently diving into the world of **web development**!   
I'm **new to GitHub** and using it to track my progress as I build projects and learn new technologies.

## What I'm Learning:

- **Back-end**: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, JSON, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Upcoming**: React
- **Expanding my skills in**: Web page authoring, server-side scripting, APIs, authentication, and database integration

## What I'm Working On:
- Hands-on projects to practice what I learn
- Exploring full-stack development by combining front-end and back-end technologies

## Looking Forward To:
- Collaborating on open-source projects
- Building real-world applications
- Improving my Git and GitHub workflow

**Let's Connect!**  
I'm always open to learning and collaborating. Feel free to check out my projects and follow my journey!
